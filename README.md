# interactive-brokers-api

Around 2008 Arbit started using a primitive Ameritrade REST API to make trades.  I dropped that out when I moved to the EDGAR Form4 work.  More recently I began using Interactive Brokers.  This is some early fiddling around to write a simple mean reversion test using S&P futures.

I've written this code a bunch of times since 2011, but seem to forget what I did with it and then write it again.
